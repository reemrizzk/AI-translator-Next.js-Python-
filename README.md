## Introduction

The AI Translator project is designed to facilitate language translation through an intuitive web interface. It uses Next.js, a React framework, for the front-end to create a user-friendly experience, and Python for the back-end to handle translation requests using AI models, and output it in JSON format.

The project uses transformers AI models to accurately translate text between various languages, providing an efficient and easy-to-use solution for language barriers.
